# Machine-Learning

This repo contains some code that I wrote while learning about various machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Clustering, Multiple Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Feature Selection) during my 2021 summer research. 

Note that this repo **does not** contain code from my actual research project.
